Hi Team,
My account will be blocked 2/28/2022 need your help

I am new to AWS and I Just started learning resources of different services available on AWS. I was not aware of the charges for the uses of resources. 
I have a talk with your representative who helped me to know about the resources which were active and generating costs and guide me to find active resources which i have terminated.
So I would request to waive off the bill as I am still a student and I cannot afford to pay the bill as I come from a humble background.
I will make sure that I am utilizing the services and its resources keeping the costing in mind in the future.

Thanks
Avinash
